## Cordova BLE Plugin

The plugin has functions that allows your app to act as a BLE client.
You can:
* scan for devices
* connect to them
* list services, characteristics and descriptors
* read and write characteristics and descriptors
* request notification
* poll RSSI (signal strength)

To build documentation, run this command:
jsdoc -l -c conf.json ble.js

This plugin is implemented on Android and iOS.
